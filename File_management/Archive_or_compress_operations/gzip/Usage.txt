用途 | Usage
	from "man gzip"
		Gzip  reduces  the  size  of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding
		(LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by  one  with  the
		extension  .gz,  while  keeping the same ownership modes, access and
		modification times.  (The default extension is -gz for  VMS,  z  for
		MSDOS,  OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are speci‐
		fied, or if a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed  to
		the  standard  output.   Gzip  will only attempt to compress regular
		files.  In particular, it will ignore symbolic links.
