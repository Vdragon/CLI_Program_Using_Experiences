命令列參數與選項 | Commandline auguments & options
-c, --bytes=K
	output  the  last K bytes; alternatively, use -c +K to output bytes
	starting with the Kth of each file

-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
	output appended data as the file grows; -f,  --follow,  and  --fol‐
	low=descriptor are equivalent

-F     same as --follow=name --retry

-n, --lines=K
	output  the  last  K lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +K to
	output lines starting with the Kth

--retry
	keep trying to open a file even when it is or becomes inaccessible;
	useful when following by name, i.e., with --follow=name

-s, --sleep-interval=N
	with -f, sleep for approximately N seconds  (default  1.0)  between
	iterations.   With  inotify  and  --pid=P, check process P at least
	once every N seconds.
